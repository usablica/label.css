# label.css

> Just a simply easy way to label each element you want!

## How To Use

You can use label.css in your site in just few steps:

**1)** Include `label.css` in your web page. you can use min version for production. <br/>
**2)** Add Class `label` to your element. then use `data-label` for label text that will add on the element. <br/>
**3)** Start Positioning! 

<br/>

For example: 
```html
    <figure class="label inside bottom" data-label="Just an easy and simple way to label everything.">
```

## Positions

Label.css supports both `outside` and `inside` positions as the label place. Use the class `outside` to put the label outside of the element and `inside` to put it inside.
Outside label can goes to `top` or `bottom`.
Inside mode supports these positions: `top`, `bottom`, `middle`, `left` and `right` just adding class with the same class name.

## Effects

You can add hover effects to your label! Two effects `fade` and `float` are available. more effects can be added by you and your creativity!

For example:
```html
    <figure class="label inside bottom fade" data-label="Just an easy and simple way to label everything.">
```
